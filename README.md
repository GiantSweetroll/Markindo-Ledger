<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="./screenshots/alokasi.png">

This project was part of my project for IB DP ITGS Internal Assessment.

Pt Markindo Mataritama is a marketing agent company. They help their clients by providing support in their marketing programs in an effort to increase sales. The company has a lot of things that they do to achieve their goal or target. One of which is data management between stock and deliveries. Problem is, the data between stock and deliveries are not integrated with one another. They are kept separate. This reduces data accuracy and may lead to inconsistent data or values between items. This issue may lead to bad relation between Pt Markindo Mataritama and their clients.

They need to keep track of data of stock and deliveries of items. The number of items delivered needs to correlate with the data from stock. This is to prevent delivering the number of items incorrectly. Since the two sets of data are currently kept separate, this is a likely issue to happen. As he has said, the solution to this issue is to have an application that would integrate the data from stock and deliveries together. Doing this will far reduce data inaccuracy or inconsistency as the number of items delivered would have a direct relation to the stock.
